about: The Research Bazaar is a (free-of-charge) 3-day intensive conference where researchers come together to up-skill in ‘next generation digital research tools and skills’.  In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!<br><br> Who should attend? Researchers at ALL levels from ALL disciplines. PhD and research Masters students are especially encouraged to apply. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along!<br><br>We are still working on the programme to bring you a broad range of digital research skills topics - below are some of the sessions that will be on offer. <br><br> <b>Update 13/12/2016 - We're full! Please email <a href="mailto:res.baz@otago.ac.nz?Subject=ResBaz%20Dunedin%20wait%20list%20request">res.baz@otago.ac.nz</a> to be added to the wait list.</b> <br><br> <b>Update 31/01/2017 - speaker and session schedule now available - see below!</b><br><br>

    - name: Getting started with command line tools
      id: clt
      blurb: Need to use programs on the command line, but not sure how to get started, or how to set up your working environment?  We can help you!
    - name: Jupyter notebooks
      id: jupyter
      blurb: Create and share web-based documents that contain live code!  

schedule: Each day at ResBaz will be split into morning and afternoon events. Following a Key Story from one of our exciting speakers, the mornings will consist of introductory <a href='https://software-carpentry.org/'>Software Carpentry</a> lessons, alongside intermediate and advanced topics for those who are already familar with the introductory material. Afternoon sessions will begin with a second Key Story, followed by a more informal collection of activities, including focussed workshops, dicussion sessions, and lightning research presentations.  At the end of each afternoon we will reconvence for a discusion session, to help set the scene for an evening of fun social and networking activities. <br><br>
