about: | 
   On the **8th – 10th February 2017** Massey University, Manawatu will host its inaugural 
   ResBaz event, under and overarching theme of **Research Workflow**. The Research Bazaar is a growing international conference promoting the digital literacy emerging at the centre of modern research. 

   An interesting aspect of ResBaz is the emphasis on community and Open Access; they are not institutional specific, but region wide. On the 8th – 10th February 2017, events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe. The aim of these events is to equip researchers from all career stages with the digital skills and tools required to do their research better, faster and smarter. 

   A unique blend of academic and social life, ResBaz is an event unlike traditional academic conferences. One of the key aspects of ResBaz is the use of training and training packages developed by Software and Data Carpentry. Software Carpentry is a global volunteer organisation that has led the way in researcher-led training. Their lessons on scientific computing (e.g. unix shell, Python, MATLAB, R, git/GitHub) are Open Source and a perfect fit for a ResBaz conference.

   blurb: "Rochelle is the Senior Advisor at the Open Government Information and Data Programme. With a passion for transparency, accountability and justice, Rochelle has long been a firm believer in open government and open educat   ion. Rochelle’s focus is on driving active engagement between government, business, civil society and academia. Describing herself as    an Intrapreneur, Rochelle works to wrangle change from inside existing systems. Rochelle’s recent work with Victoria University’s Centre for Applied Cross-cultural Research, and New Zealand’s Open Government Inform   ation and Data Programme, has driven Rochelle’s passion to see equality and access to the digital economy freely available to all. As an Arts graduate, Rochelle spent her former years teaching tertiary art. She then moved into roles providing strategic and business advice across the corporate, government and NGO sectors, and completed post-graduate study in Strategic Studies. Rochelle also ran her own charity, Daya Trust, which empowered women and girls through education, and was Co-Founder of Wellington start-up, the Arabic Digital Reform Institute."
 - name: Dave Wheeler
   img: img/david_w.jpg
   blurb: "Dr Dave Wheeler of Massey University is particularly interested in using next generation sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, and molecular biology to study genes and genomes in non-model but ecologically relevant organisms. Currently his main research organism is a small cosmopolitan parasitoid wasp called Nasonia vitripennis. He is using Nasonia to investigate a range of molecular and evolutionary questions, especially those relating to RNAi mechanisms and host parasite interactions. Nasonia also parasitises the pupae of a wide range of filth flies making it an important biological control agent for human and livestock pest species."

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>
We are living in a constantly changing world. Where the industrial revolution shifted our world through economies of scale, our new data driven world is bringing economies of speed. The digital economy  is driving infinitely more fluid ways of using data, and expectations data be used in multiple ways for multiple purposes. Researchers and policy makers are rarely the only holders of data these days. Instead governments, civil society organisations, and businesses are all active participants in opening, sharing, and using data. What does that mean for researchers? Rochelle Stewart-Allen will discuss how opening and sharing data is changing the world, the impact this is having on academia, and how data is being used to drive social and economic change.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it’s a power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so they aren’t typing the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources (including “high-performance computing” supercomputers). These lessons will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.</p>
